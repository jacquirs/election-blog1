<p>This week, I will explore the importance of several new variables to determine how to best predict two way popular vote within contentious states in the 2024 presidential election. These include incumbency measures, federal spending, and expert prediction. I will them discuss the comparison of past models to the time for change model and finish with my new prediction using super learning.</p>
<div id="historical-analysis-of-incumbency" class="section level3">
<h3>Historical Analysis of Incumbency</h3>
<p>The incumbency status of a party or particular candidate can effect how they are perceived by the electorate and as a result their popular vote outcome, as mentioned in past weeks. The question lies in the mechanism behind the incumbent advantage or disadvantage: does it focus solely on the incumbent president and their specific actions or benefit the party of the incumbent in general?</p>
<p>Diving deeper into the results of presidential elections since 1952, I can aggregate the results of incumbent candidates and incumbent parties to see if they benefit from their prior positions. Of these 18 elections, only 33% have re-elected a sitting president. However, only 11 of these elections included an incumbent who was running, and 63.64% won (7 out of 11 elections). Additionally, looking only at the 6 elections since 2000, 4 of which included incumbents, 3 of the 4 won, Donald Trump being the only one who wasn’t re-elected.</p>
<p>While looking at incumbent presidents appears to show that incumbents have a greater than random chance of winning a re-election campaign, looking at incumbent party results does not tell the same story. The incumbent party has lost 10 of the last 18 presidential elections since 1952, and filtering for elections where the candidate served in the previous administration, only 27.78% won.</p>

<h3>Incumbency Advantages and Disadvantages</h3>
<p>Diving deeper into the structural factors that could be a source of the incumbency advantage for candidates, I will explore a variety of institutional factors may impact the result of an election in their favor. These factors include:
- Bully Pulpit: ability to shape public opinion, as well as access to name recognition and media attention
- Campaigning: have a time advantage, never stop campaigning
- Party Nominations: challengers have to fight for nomination while incumbent isn’t beat up and doesn’t use resources
- Powers of the Office: can control spending to gain favor with constituents
- Pork Barrel Spending: can target certain districts for reelection</p>
<p>While these may be potential advantages for incumbents, these are only theoretical reasons that may help in reelection with not a lot of empirical evidence. Presidential spending on disasters in particular is one that has some empirical evidence behind its impact on the presidential level.</p>
<p>This is explored in the literature. According to <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-experimental-political-science/article/voters-dont-care-much-about-incumbency/ECFE39E003912F8AF65C2AD14A34BD8C">Brown (2014)</a>, the electoral advantage typically associated with incumbents is largely due to structural factors rather than voter preferences. In a randomized survey experiment, Brown found that once these structural advantages are held constant, voters exhibit minimal preference for incumbents over challengers. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that partisanship, rather than incumbency, plays a larger role in shaping voter preferences, and there is no significant evidence of incumbency fatigue or diminishing support for long-serving incumbents.</p>
<p>Incumbency also has theoretical disadvantages, including that polarized electorates lead partisanship to matter more than incumbency as seen in <a href="https://fisherpub.sjf.edu/polisci_facpub/14/">Donovan et al (2019)</a>. Recessions and disasters are also often blamed on incumbents, per <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvc7770q">Achen and Bartel’s 2016 book “Democracy for Realists”</a>. There also also some theoretical ideas of incumbency fatigue, and though Brown disproved those in his study, there may need to be further research as to how this applies to this election in particular.</p>
<p>Both candidates in 2024 have name recognition and past experience with the electorate, which may be difficult to model incumbency effects exactly, but with these results it seems acceptable to assume that the impact of incumbency for both candidates may be negligible or cancel each other out.</p>
