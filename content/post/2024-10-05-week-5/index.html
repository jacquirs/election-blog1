<p><em>Note: For this week of class, I was in charge of putting together a presentation of my findings. As a result, this post and the accompanying code as seen on Github contain many more plots than in past weeks, many of which are simply descriptive and exploratory statistics.</em></p>
<p>Happy 30 days until the election all! This week, I focus on refining my models by introducing the final fundamentals I have learned in class, demographics and turnout data. Additionally, I hone in on the states identified last week through expert prediction to be those I will model exclusively as they are the swing states that could decided the next president of the United States. These states are <strong>Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Nevada, Michigan, Georgia, and Arizona</strong>.</p>
<p>The decision to predict the popular vote in these states alone stems from the expert predictions from organizations like the <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/">Cook Political Report</a> and <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/">Sabato’s Crystal Ball</a>, who predict most other states to be safely in either Donald Trump’s or Kamala Harris’s court for the upcoming election. As such, I count their electoral vote for their respective candidate and move to predict the lesser known outcomes of the seven swing states.</p>
<p>In this blog post, I begin by exploring the voterfiles for these key states, diving into the specific demographics and those which are most associated with voting behavior. Additionally, I replicate Kim &amp; Zilinsky (2023) findings on the power of demographics to predict turnout and voter share using ANES data, deciding if and how to incorporate this new data point into my model. Building on the elastic net regression ensemble of polling data and economic fundamentals from the last few posts, I explore simulations of the result of the election, also considering random forest methods.</p>

<h3>Exploring the Voterfile</h3>
<p>Voterfile data allow me to see granular information on the demographic characteristics of the voting population of each state. The voterfiles for this post were graciously provided by <a href="https://statara.com/">Statara Solutions</a>. In the following plots, I break down the voterfile data for our seven states of interest</p>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="50%" />
The gender splits of each state are not surprising, with most being around 50/50. While gender alone may not be able to provide significant and high percentage information on who someone is voting for or whether they turn out, what combined with other demographic variables it is possible it may be a statistically significant predictor, as I will explore below.</p>

The distribution of race demographics in the states of interest is more varied than gender. As certain racial demographics may lead to certain political views, which I will attempt to explore later, these different makeups may lead to differing support for the two candidates in these states. The fact that the voters have different characteristics may make it likely that they may support different candidates. It is important also to note that while many states have a large number of white people on the voterfile, large groups of minorities like the hispanic popular of Arizona or African American population of Georgia are often cited on the news as important voting blocks to watch for. However, it is likely that these groups are not a monolith.</p>

The variation in age may also effect turnout or popular vote outcomes, especially when combined with other demographic variables. Age is consistently found to be a good predictor of turnout in logit regressions of historical data, as in <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/30024496">Matsusaka and Palida (1997)</a>. They also find education to be a good predictor. Looking later at Kim and Zelinsky (2023), I will explore how much of past turnout and popular vote outcomes these and other demographic variables can really explain.</p>
<p>While looking at demographics alone can tell me about the makeup of each state, it is also important to understand how each group acts. Below, I plot the percent of people in each age x race category that voted in the 2020 general election. For many groups, it surprisingly low, while for others there is incredibly high turnout (though these groups are consistently very small). The height of each bar represents the percentage of people in that age and race category who voted in the 2020 general election.</p>

As is often observed in the literature, there is low turnout in 2020 among young people, but it is worth noting that 18 is the first year they can vote, and the ages in this data are up to date with 2024, making that group significantly smaller in the first place. To understand whether young people actually vote less, it would be best to dive into those currently aged 22-28 to see if and how they voted in 2020.</p>
<p>Below I also include these graphs as heat maps for ease of reading, but feel free to use whichever works best for your understanding.</p>

<p>Overall, these demographic explorations provide the context necessary as I move into exploring whether they are good to include in my predictive model.</p>
