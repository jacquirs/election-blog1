<p>This week, I will explore the importance of several new variables to determine how to best predict two way popular vote within contentious states in the 2024 presidential election. These include incumbency measures, federal spending, and expert prediction. I will them discuss the comparison of past models to the time for change model and finish with my new prediction using super learning.</p>

<h3>Historical Analysis of Incumbency</h3>
<p>The incumbency status of a party or particular candidate can effect how they are perceived by the electorate and as a result their popular vote outcome, as mentioned in past weeks. The question lies in the mechanism behind the incumbent advantage or disadvantage: does it focus solely on the incumbent president and their specific actions or benefit the party of the incumbent in general?</p>
<p>Diving deeper into the results of presidential elections since 1952, I can aggregate the results of incumbent candidates and incumbent parties to see if they benefit from their prior positions. Of these 18 elections, only 33% have re-elected a sitting president. However, only 11 of these elections included an incumbent who was running, and 63.64% won (7 out of 11 elections). Additionally, looking only at the 6 elections since 2000, 4 of which included incumbents, 3 of the 4 won, Donald Trump being the only one who wasn’t re-elected.</p>
<p>While looking at incumbent presidents appears to show that incumbents have a greater than random chance of winning a re-election campaign, looking at incumbent party results does not tell the same story. The incumbent party has lost 10 of the last 18 presidential elections since 1952, and filtering for elections where the candidate served in the previous administration, only 27.78% won.</p>
<p>This is supported by the literature, but with even more limited support for incumbent candidates. According to <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-experimental-political-science/article/voters-dont-care-much-about-incumbency/ECFE39E003912F8AF65C2AD14A34BD8C">Brown (2014)</a>, the electoral advantage typically associated with incumbents is largely due to structural factors rather than voter preference. In a randomized survey experiment, Brown found that once these structural advantages are held constant, voters exhibit minimal preference for incumbents over challengers. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that partisanship, rather than incumbency, plays a larger role in shaping voter preferences, and there is no significant evidence of incumbency fatigue or diminishing support for long-serving incumbents.</p>

<h3>Incumbency Advantages and Disadvantages</h3>
<p>Just because the direct study by Brown does not reveal that incumbency alone makes people vote one way or the other does not mean that they are not at an advantage. For incumbent candidates, a variety of institutional factors may impact the result of an election in their favor.</p>
<p>the factors
Bully pulpit
Politicians in office command public attention such that people know who they are and they can shape public opinion
Don’t have to fight for media or name recognition
Campaigning
Have time advantage, never stop campaigning
Party nominations
Challengers have to fight other in nomination and this gives advantage to incumbent who is not beat up by opponents and don’t have to use resources for that
Powers of the office
Powers of office can help reelection
Can control spending to gain favor with constituents
Pork barrel spending
Spending targeted at certain districts
Helps with reelection
Theoretical reasons to believe this would help in reelection but not a lot of empirical evidence
On president level, relationship between federal spending on disaster in an area and votes for the incumbent in that area
Seems like buying votes</p>
<p>General incumbency considerations
Components of incumbency advantage?:
More media coverage, name recognition
Campaign finance access
“Pork” → short-term economic gains (Bartels 2008), credit-claiming (Kriner and Reeves, 2012)
Possible disadvantages of incumbency?
Polarized electorate → partisanship, not incumbency matters (Donovan et al., 2019) Recessions, disasters → blame attribution (Achen and Bartels, 2016) Incumbency fatigue</p>
<p>Both candidates in 2024 have name recognition and past experience with the electorate, which may be difficult to model exactly, but with these results it seems acceptable to assume that the impact of incumbency for both candidates may be negligible or cancel each other out.</p>
